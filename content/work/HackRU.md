### Sledge - Internal judging platform

- Project Slegde aims to enhance hackers and judges hackathon experiences. 
- Instead of jotting down notes on papers and having a hard time determining the winner, Sledge provides a web app that judges can rank hack submissions online and we will suggest who will be the winners!
