### Summary
My personal website written with React, JavaScript, and Nextjs to statically generate content pages from Markdown files.

After watching a lot of website tutorials, having a website for my own is interesting and satisfying! It turns out that developing a website on my own is not as easy as the tutorials or applying the themes, there are edge cases to solve and it requires creativity to transform official libraries/frameworks documents into actual valuable products.

However, this current version of my website is not the end. I intend to maintain and improve my website constantly, since I found some interesting sources in designing UI websites.

### Future Implementations Plan:
