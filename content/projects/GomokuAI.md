## Summary

Gomoku AI is a 20x20 version of Tic-tac-toe. A player wins when they score 5 moves in a row. It was interesting to implement Min-Max Tree. I made an effort to improve my skills in writing architectural programs in C++ and enhance AI, which included:

- Implemeted Alpha-beta Pruning to reduce run-time of each move by 60%.
- Created heuristics function that deliver move's accuracy up to 70% within 2 seconds.
- Organizing my code using OOP and splitting files into singular modules for accessible and expandable structures, following SOLID rules.
