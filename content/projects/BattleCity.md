### Summary
You can replay your childhood Battle City here. This was my practice to exercise the power of OOP in Java in Object-Oriented Programming course.

I made this project with my friend to practice all the foundational concepts of OOP, including:
- SOLID principles
- Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
- Singleton Pattern
- Reverse Dependency for expandable code structures
