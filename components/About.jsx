                            <span role="img">ðŸ‘‹</span>Hi, I'm Long. I'm a senior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick
                            I'm pursuing a BS degree in Computer Science with an expected graduation in December 2023. 
                            What I'm most passionate about are cultivating technical solutions to real-world problems, 
                            advocating sustainability, and building community-driven applications. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span role="img">ðŸŒŠ</span>I appreciate every challenge I
                            came across that helped cultivate my self-efficacy in
                            this risk-taking world. In my Computer Science program,
                            I enjoyed my CS and Math courses most, which problem-solving oriented
                            and they all aim to deliver sharp results. While learning those courses, 
                            I learned the importance of staying open-mind to look at many different 
                            aspects of a problem. Whether those problems are adapting new technology 
                            or framework to our product, implementing complex algorithms and solve company's 
                            massive problem, or launching and maintaining a web app. The key of success is the 
                            flexibility of our mind and our will to trial and error. I feel highly motivated as 
                            I discover new tools and ideas to improve our solutions and bring results 
                            that beyond satisfiable to people whom using my products.

                            <span role="img">ðŸŒ¿</span>I love to organize my room on
                            a regular basis. Such habit transfers to my every aspect
                            of life. I always try to start the day with a
                            goal-oriented mindset and bring my organized
                            characteristics to the work I do for maximum
                            productivity. Rather than following rigid approaches, I
                            prefer to strive to expand my comfort zone and adopt
                            unconventional methods to build sustainable solutions.

                            <span role="img">ðŸŒ¤</span>What compels me to wake up for
                            work and become fully charged for the day is knowing I
                            have another chance to bring warmth and friendship to my
                            community. I thrive in jobs that foster diversity and
                            culture, enjoying collaborations with people from
                            different walks of life for a shared mission. Not only
                            do I see it as a chance to accumulate new knowledge, but
                            also to deeply connect with others through their
                            different views at problems. I aim to be a team player,
                            be in tune with the emotional needs of those around me,
                            and thrive on positive reinforcement.
